You will need to install MATLAB or [GNU Octave][gnu-octave] to do this lesson.

You will also need to download some data, which we will analyze using MATLAB:

1.  Make a new folder in your Desktop called matlab-novice-inflammation.
2.  Download [matlab-novice-inflammation-data.zip](https://github.com/swcarpentry/matlab-novice-inflammation/blob/gh-pages/data/matlab-novice-inflammation-data.zip) and move the file to this folder.
3.	If itâ€™s not unzipped yet, double-click on it to unzip it; this will place all the data in the `matlab-novice-inflammation` directory.
4.	You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:

~~~
cd Desktop/python-novice-inflammation/data
~~~
{: .bash}

[gnu-octave]: https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/
